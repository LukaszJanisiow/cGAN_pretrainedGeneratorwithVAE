# Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) Implementation

This project implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)** from scratch using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to generate facial images based on selected features.

## Overview

To address the challenge of stabilizing training for the generator in a cGAN, a **two-step training strategy** was employed:

1. **Pretraining with Conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE):**
   - The generator was trained as a decoder in a cVAE to generate realistic images.  
   - This pretraining step helped the generator learn basic features effectively.

2. **Fine-tuning with cGAN:**
   - The pretrained generator was added to the cGAN and further trained using adversarial techniques.  
   - This step improved the quality and accuracy of the generated images, especially for complex features.

### Observations
While the cVAE was effective at generating basic features, it struggled with producing specific attributes such as **hats, bangs, and wavy hair**.

### Images Generated by cGAN
The following images demonstrate improvements achieved through adversarial fine-tuning with cGAN:

Features from top:  
- Eyeglasses, Hat, Bangs, Wavy Hair, Pointy Nose, Mustache, Oval Face, Smile  

#### Images with Multiple Features:
Below are examples of images generated by the cGAN with multiple attributes:

This hybrid training approach showcases the benefits of combining variational autoencoders with adversarial models for conditional image generation.
